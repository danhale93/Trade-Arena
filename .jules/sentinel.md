**Vulnerability:** Information disclosure via `X-Powered-By` header and potential rate-limiting bypass/DoS due to missing `trust proxy` setting.
**Learning:** Default Express configurations often leak server technology details and fail to correctly identify client IPs behind proxies, which can cripple rate-limiting defenses.
**Prevention:** Always disable `x-powered-by`, set `trust proxy` when behind a load balancer, and use strict `Referrer-Policy` to prevent URL leakage.
